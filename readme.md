# GitHub Organization

I've created a [GitHub organization](https://github.com/orgs/CDSeattleMEAN201706) for this class.  Please create a repository in that organization with your name (so my repo is `jack_brounstein`) by clicking the green "New" button in the right-hand sidebar.  Each day, some assignments will be marked with **GitHub**; in addition to uploading those files to the platform, please also push them into your GitHub repo.  The hope is that this will help you become more familiar with using version control as well as make it convenient for me to check your progress at a glance.

Don't remember how to push things to GitHub?  Look up these commands:

* `git init`
* `git add .`
* `git commit -m "some message"`
* `git push`

Don't have access to the organization?  Send me your GitHub username on Slack.

Assignments|
---|
Creating Objects II|
Creating Objects III **GitHub**|

Optional|
---|
Bind, Call, and Apply|


### Wednesday, June 7

Advanced JavaScript: Callbacks, closures, immediate functions

We are mostly skipping the Node.js chapter--it explains in great detail how to run a web server with only Node, but for the rest of the course, we'll be using Express, which does the same thing but with much more convenient syntax.  However, make sure you read the "Node Modules" tab and complete the "Math Module" assignment.

Assignments|
---|
JavaScript Library|
Button Fun|
Math Module **GitHub**|

Optional|
---|
Hunting GitHub|
DojoQuery|
Fib + Nacci|
Game Ideas|


### Thursday, June 8

Express: Building a web server in JavaScript

We'll also be skipping the socket.io portion.  Sockets are really cool, but they're not covered on the belt exam, and I'd rather give you an extra day to practice full MEAN.  We'll talk about socket.io during project week.

Assignments|
---|
Survey Form **GitHub**|


### Friday, June 9

Oh no, Mongo!

Message board will probably take a chunk of your weekend.  Don't fret that it's taking too long--it's a large assignment, and it's important to do right.

Assignments|
---|
Intro to MongoDB|
Mongoose Dashboard|
Quoting Dojo Redux **GitHub**|
Message Board **GitHub**|

## Week 2

### Monday, June 12

Modularization: Turning one giant server file into several smaller files

We'll also talk about using `express-session` to handle login/registration

1955 API might not seem like much, but it's actually a very important assignment.  If you can complete it, you'll have pretty much all you need on the server side for a MEAN app...which is good, because tomorrow we start dealing with the client side.

Assignments|
---|
Modularized Mongoose|
1955 API **GitHub**|

### Tuesday, June 13

Angular 4!  Note that we're working from the chapter labeled "Angular", on the second page of the MEAN material, not the "AngularJS" chapter, which is for Angular 1.

TypeScript and Components.

Assignments|
---|
My first app|
Facts **GitHub**|
Currency **GitHub**|


Optional|
---|
Types and Classes|
Interfaces|
Pacman|
Bomberman|
Attribute Directives (Read this: There's some very useful material here.  It's just not really an assignment.)|

### Wednesday, June 14

Event listeners, nested components, inputs and output

Read Architecture & Nested Components

Assignments|
---|
Registration|
Login|
Login, Registration, and More **GitHub**|
Components|
Shared Data|
Task List **GitHub**|

### Thursday, June 15

Angular routes and services

Read Routing & Observables and Services, Promises, & HTTP.  Note that we'll be using the HTTP module tomorrow to make requests to our server once we have a full MEAN app.

In the afternoon, we'll build a custom pipe to filter an array of data

Assignments|
---|
Weather Report|
Dashboard, Login, and Registration|
Task Application|


### Friday, June 16

Angular review + full MEAN!

When running a full MEAN application, we'll replace `ng serve` with `ng build -w` (and `nodemon server.js`, of course!)

Five assignments may look like a lot, but the first four are all building individual pieces that are combined into MEAN Friends.  Also note that this chapter was written when we were still using Angular 1, so some of the specific code samples (anything client side, basically) no longer apply; use what we've learned to replicate the functionality that the platform describes.

Assignments|
---|
File Structure and Simple Server|
Friends API|
Angular Friends|
MEAN Friends **GitHub**|


## Week 3

### Monday, June 19
